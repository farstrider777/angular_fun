plan for app -

home component -
holds array of list components - might switch to array of lists which are each template strings
each list holds array of list-item components
maybe just strings to start with for list items - these will now be additions to the main string

home component has start list function that creates a list component
use localStorage and sessionStorage like I did in the pair program to hold
data for the next session of list making
home component can also be responsible for loading all the lists at the start of the
app from localStorage
we can use sessionStorage for warnings that we want to stay up for a reload or maybe
cool color effects
