plan for app -

home component -
holds array of list components
each list holds array of list-item components
maybe just strings to start with for list items

home component has start list function that creates a list component
use localStorage and sessionStorage like I did in the pair program to hold
data for the next session of list making
home component can also be responsible for loading all the lists at the start of the
app from localStorage
we can use sessionStorage for warnings that we want to stay up for a reload or maybe
cool color effects
